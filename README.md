## Disclaimer

This is the unofficial [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/) shard for Mailjet.
The majority of the API is covered, but some parts still need to be added.

## Requirements

To use the Mailjet API client, you will need a free
[Mailjet account](https://app.mailjet.com/signup).

## Installation

1. Add the dependency to your `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  mailjet:
    github: wout/mailjet.cr
```

2. Run `shards install`

## Usage

```crystal
require "mailjet"
```

### Send your first email

```crystal
response = Mailjet::SendV3_1.message({
  "From": {
    "Email": "from@email.com",
    "Name":  "Me",
  },
  "To": [
    {
      "Email": "to@email.com",
      "Name":  "You",
    },
  ],
  "Subject":  "My first Mailjet Email!",
  "TextPart": "Greetings from Mailjet!",
  "HTMLPart": <<-HTML
    <h3>
      Dear passenger 1, welcome to
      <a href='https://www.mailjet.com/'>Mailjet</a>!
    </h3>
    <br />
    May the delivery force be with you!
  HTML
})

puts response.status
# => "success"
```

### Send multiple messages

```crystal
response = Mailjet::SendV3_1.messages([
  {...},
  {...}
])

puts response.first.status
# => "success"
```

### Retrieve sent messages

Now, let’s view the status of the sent message and its configuration specifics.

```crystal
message = Mailjet::Message.find(576460754655154659)
puts message.status
# => "opened"
```

### View message history

You can track important events linked to the sent emails, for example whether
the recipient opened the message, or clicked on a link within.

```crystal
events = Mailjet::Messagehistory.all(576460754655154659)
puts events.first.event_type
# => "sent"
puts events.last.event_type
# => "opened"
```

### Retrieve Statistics

The Mailjet API also has a variety of resources that help retrieve aggregated
statistics for key performance indicators like opens, clicks, unsubscribes, etc.

Let's take a look at just one of those resources to give you a sample of the
data you can read - we’ll retrieve total aggregated statistics for your API key.

```crystal
counters = Mailjet::Statcounters.by_api_key({
  counter_timing:     "event",
  counter_resolution: "hour",
  from_ts:            Time.local.at_beginning_of_day.to_unix,
  to_ts:              Time.local.to_unix,
})
puts counters.first.event_opened_count
# => 28
```
